Solution:

https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/solution/

Histroy:

- Attempt I
  - BUG: the condition of "while" clause: while (min_l <**=** max_l)
- Attempt II
  - BUG: return **float**((lnum + rnum)) / 2

### P10 Regular Expression Matching

Sort of like search with a cache, of course you can call it DP...

At first, when I encounter the *, I will iterate which part it will replace. But actually you can just escape this by simply using: f[i,j] = (first_match and f[i+1, j]) or f[i, j+2]

**Interesting finding**

During coding, I found out in the python, you cannot using *f = [[0] * 2] * 3* to initilaize a 2-d array. However, it's okay to use *f = [0] * 3*. The reason behind this is the **list** is *mutable variable*, while the **int** is *immutatble variable*. When applying a ***** operation to list, it will duplicate the list using the same refference. If the list contains int, assignment will create a new int and assign it. But if the element of list is list, it will not create a new list when assign one element. As a result, it modify all the value in one row

### P32 Longest Valid Parentheses

- Solution I
  - f[i, j] denotes whether substring s[i: j] is legal
  - f[i, j] = true if (f[i+1, j-1]) or (f[i, k] and f[k, j] and s[k-1] == ')' and s[k] == '(')
  - Prerequisite
    - j - i % 2 == 0
    - s[i] == '(' and s[j-1] == ')'
  - TLE: Overall time complexity is O(n^3)
- Solution II
  - f[i] denotes the longest valid parenthese ending at index i
  - Prerequisite
    - s[i] == ')'
  - if s[i-1] == '('
    - f[i] = (f[i - 2] if i >= 2 else 0) + 2
  - if s[i-1] == ')'
    - Then we need a extra '(' to match s[i] (which is ')')
    - Before this extra '(', there may be a valid parenthese string before and after it
    - f[i] = 2 + f[i-1] + f[i - f[i - 1] - 2]
    - Why must be f[i -1], which means the extra '(' is right before the longest parenthesis?
      - It's clearly that there won't be any extra '(' in the longest valid string, so this '(' should only be before the longest valid string. But if it's not at i - f[i - 1] - i, then this string will be invalid.

    - Attempt I: forget to check whether the index is valid



### P55 Jump Game

- Attempt I
  - Define a set *f* to be the set of reachable index, and iterate the array from start. If this index is in the *f*, then we can update the *f* since we can perform *jump* operation here.
  - This method TLE in the last data
- Attempt II
  - After a little consideration, I found out we don't need to maintain this *f* and just store the *farest* index we can arrive. It saves the operation of maintain *f*, and cut the time complexity from O(nm) to O(n) (m is the average of MAX_JUMP)
- This simple solution can even beat 89.5% solutionâ€¦ (
- The fastest solution search from the right to make it faster, it's smart.

### P141&P142

- Purpose: detect and identify the loop in linklist
- **BUG**
  - check if the head is nullptr
  - consider the boundry scenario (one node, no loop)
